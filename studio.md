# It's not myspace

A classic brick building that was built by several people who at the time thought it was a good idea.

As few modifications as possible are made so that the art can be created with the space. It's a design choice, to spend the energy manipuating the space to suit a certain sound or to create sound based on the existing soundscape. Either way takes a long time and a lot of effort.

Technically, it's classfied by the local zoning folks as an apartment. However, it is unclear what it is a part or apart from. I assume, like most struces, it's ment to contain objects and project them against the "environmental conditions".

So, we call it a "studio" and slap an illritative adverb in front to sound catchy.

Equipment is mostly used, if not just found in alley. We loath the commonly accepted belief that thousands upon thousands of dollars are required to create "professional" art.
